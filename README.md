# Space-Invaders_GRAPHICS

Space Invader is a graphics-based application that brings an interactive 3D space experience to users. This project utilizes the OpenGL library to render and animate graphics within a 3D environment. The primary goal of the project is to create an immersive space-themed experience where users can witness moving graphics and explore a simulated space setting.

## Features

- Utilizes OpenGL library for rendering graphics.
- Implements 3D graphics in a space-themed environment.
- Dynamic movement of graphics within the 3D space.
- Uses data structures and algorithms for efficient rendering and animation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python installed on your system.
- Ensure OpenGL library is installed. You can install it using pip:
    ```
    pip install PyOpenGL
    ```

### Running the Application

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the application using `main.py`:
    ```
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage

Upon running `main.py`, the application will launch the space-themed graphics environment. Users can interact with the environment to experience the moving graphics within the 3D space.
